          Rich people don’t sleep eight hours a day! That’s a third of your life. It ain’t but 24 hours in a day. You cannot be sleep eight hours a day. You can’t live in L.A. and wake up at 8 o’clock in the morning.
          It’s 11 o’clock on the east coast. The stock market (has) been open two hours. They already making decisions about your life and your ass was sleep.

        “You’re going to go through a time where you’re not going to make any money. It’s not going to be a week, it’s not going to be a month, it’s not going to be one year. 
        It’s going to be years. And during that time, if you don’t love what you do, it’s going to be very hard to stick it out. That is something that people don’t understand when they hear, “Follow your passion.” 
        They hear rainbows, unicorns, bullshit. But the truth of it is that it’s important, because if you don’t enjoy what you’re doing, you’re going to be that much more likely to quit when shit’s hard.”

          <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">
            On Saturday, September 1, 2002, at 11:45 p.m., I was born at a hospital in Phnom Penh, boeurng kork II, st 315.<br> Life was simpler when I was a kid because you didn't have to worry about your future as much as you do now. When you're carefree, all you have to worry about is eating and getting a good night's sleep
            , however, when you start ageing, life begins to change.<br><br> At the age of 15, adversity began to invade my life, and I began to think more about the future and began to settle in life; however, this cannot be compared to life now, where everything is a struggle.<br><br> It is as if you are playing a video game and have missed the tutorial, and you are only running around 
            aimlessly with no understanding of how things work. Every day is a new day, and time does not wait for us, which is the most common blunder we make in life when we believe we have time. <br><br><br><br>Time is both free and valuable; you cannot own it but you can use it; you cannot keep it but you can invest it; moreover, once it is lost, it cannot be recovered. 
            This is a discipline where it can change your life if you started to change yourself.
            As for now, it is the best possible solution for me is to set daily goals for my self to work and hardening my skill for my future self.
